Pro Vocabulary:
- doesn't need much more memory infact when using INTEGER should be smaller then without
- Most times Int comparisons are faster than varchar comparisons, wegen Gro√ü und Kleinschreibung Checks, but different database systems could handle this different
- easier to maintain the idf values with vocabulary

Cons:
- Inserting and searching needs additional lookup to vocabulary and lexeme Tabelle (How much time and memory test shows)
- Searching with "LIKE" operator is much more complicated (GIN Index improves searching with LIKE)
- (Vocabulary is also easy retrievable when using distinct on the SectionTerm Tabelle)
